# NodeJS Coingecko Proxy

I wrote this simple proxy with user authentication so that people could get information from Coingecko without being locked by their API request limit (because Google uses the same servers for everyone)

You can import this project with Glitch or Heroku and have a service running that you can query using (https://github.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON)ImportJSON 
Make sure you use ImportJSONBasicAuth and create the proper environment variables for authentication.
